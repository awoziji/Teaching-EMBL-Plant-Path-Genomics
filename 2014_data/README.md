# README.md - data

## Overview

This directory contains subdirectories with data and example code to illustrate my EMBL keynote lecture delivered on 8th July 2014 at the Plant Pathogen Genomics workshop.

## Subdirectories

* `Effectors` - an interactive iPython example to illustrate binary classifier prediction success rates as baseline of positive examples changes - this is relevant to effector prediction.
* `Pba` - contains annotation and comparison (RBH) files generated during the sequencing work for *Pectobacterium atrosepticum*, and an iPython notebook demonstrating the use of [Biopython](http://www.biopython.org)'s `GenomeDiagram` module to emulate figures from the resulting publications.
* `Phytophthora` - an iPython notebook demonstrating the use of iPython to emulate Figure 2 from the *P. infestans* genome paper, showing the up- and down-stream flanking region sizes as a heatmap.
