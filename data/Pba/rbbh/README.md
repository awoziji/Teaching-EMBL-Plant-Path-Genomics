# README.md - Effectors

## Overview

This directory an iPython notebook demonstrating the use of [Biopython](http://www.biopython.org)'s `GenomeDiagram` module to emulate figures from the *Pba* sequencing and comparison papers, and data to enable this.

## Running the notebook

At the command line, issue

```
ipython notebook
```

and click on the filename `pred_acc.ipynb`, to start the notebook.

(Example output can be viewed at [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/widdowquinn/Teaching-EMBL-Plant-Path-Genomics/blob/master/data/Pba/rbbh/pba_rbh.ipynb))

## Files

* `pba_rbh.ipynb` - the iPython notebook with example code for rendering genome comparisons with `GenomeDiagram`
* `eca_vs*` - `.crunch` format comparison files containing reciprocal best BLAST hit data for each of the organism comparisons
