# README.md - Teaching-EMBL-Plant-Path-Genomics

This repository contains material for the 2016 presentation of "Pathogen Genome Data" in the "Bioinformatics of Plants and Plant Pathogens" course ([website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/2016/bioinformatics-plants-and-plant-pathogens)).

This slot is 1hr long and takes the form of a slide presentation with worked examples. The worked examples should take 15-20min each, and it is possible that the session may overrun slightly.

The worked examples are located in the `examples` subdirectory, and cover the following activities:

* Activity 1
* Activity 2
* Activity 3

There are additional worksheets covering topics from the presentation, but that could not be addressed practically in the session. These are located in the `worksheets` subdirectory.

* Worksheet 1
* Worksheet 2
* Worksheet 3
